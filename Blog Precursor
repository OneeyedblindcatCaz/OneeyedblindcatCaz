'Every idea which does not become your ideal, slays a force in your soul; every idea which becomes your 
ideal, creates within you life-forces'- Rudolf Steiner

About the author

My name is Sapna.
I'm a missionary antropologist, generalist and recently devoted transcendentalist. That is, to quote - Ralph Waldo Emerson - 'I am one who believes that society and its institutions — 
particularly organized religion and political parties— corrupt the purity of the individual. I am one who has faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant and independent".
It is only from such real individuals that true community can form.

I write from my personal experience and with the help of coming from a forward culture where I was permitted to be independent, holistic and adventurous. 
This blog will be a mixture pricipally focused on delicate subjects. Therefore, I actually want to warn people to read this blog with awareness that where I touch upon spirituality, I am not advocating for an organised viewpoint, nor to create an argument, nor even one line of thought.
Disorder rules the world because ultimately people are spirituality guided. This blog will most help those spiritually seeking if it's understood that my point is to be poignant and revealing, rather than organised and narrow, when I write about spiritual matters.
That is, to leave more of an open answer to bring more questions than to support one particular organised version of reality. Whereas, I will not hold back on my critique of society and its institutions having studied the health industry and economics in depth during my life. 

I always recommend meeting experts in person to be person if you are interested in taking spiritual advice, and also to read books! We are living in the age of information. 

Enjoy yourself, be happy, and I wish you well to find your balance. This is a young man's blog and purely informational. I look foward to sharing my deeper opinions with you as well.
