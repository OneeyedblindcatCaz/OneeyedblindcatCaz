Love is a like a poem, 
It rarely comes with pressure, 
only in leisure, 
so find your time, 
let it flow line by line, 
or else you'll risk leaving it behind. 

Being wishful is fine, 
keeps hopelessness at bay, 
puts fire in our veins, 
but bear in mind, 
it offers only temporary reprise, 
and needs soul to stay bright, 
else vengeance shall rise. 

Love and hope, 
what lifts us up the most, 
when surrounded by this dirty world, 
both burns and boasts, 
abrasive like acid rain, 
yet most needed to allieve the pain. 

Taking it personally
is only human, 
and fighting humanly, 
requires stoic grace, 
that's why grit smells so great.
