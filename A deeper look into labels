Trudging along, 
Echoing in your ears, 
Crushing your spirit, 
A bite for you, 
For you carry the label. 

Mind flopping and flipping, 
Rage rising, 
Depression looming, 
A bite for you, 
For you carry the label. 

Brow burning, 
time wasting, 
bitter appetite, 
Vengeance waiting,
A bite for you, 
For you carry the label

Ego brimming, ego flying, 
Needless of facts, 
Pride swelling, 
Grounding gone, 
A bite for you, 
For you carry the label. 

It works both ways, 
Oh so specially cruel, 
Tempting as it is to bite yourself. 
For it is it. 
Permeneant, defining, singular 
Does it sound bitter? 
Oh it's just a label. 

Labelling ourselves and finding names that embody our most important qualities is a process Carl Jung called individualisation.
