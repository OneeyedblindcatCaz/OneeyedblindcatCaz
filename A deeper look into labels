Poems


Labelling ourselves and finding names that embody our most important qualities is a process Carl Jung called individualisation.




A look into negative labels flowing - 

Autism, 


ADHD, tends to be confused. Really when people are determined, but lack ease - either they are in denial of what they are determined to do or don't quite have the right method for their skills to do it, they get their minds active, 
open minded and of course distracted, scatty - for they don't know how to put their attention but are very aware they want to find the solution to match their determination, of course generally subconciosuly. 
This is perfectly natural and drugs will not help the person.

Bipolar, tends to be confused for 'chemical imbalance' - whatever that means? Bipolar people really are polemical to others and taken seriously. They are more connected to many people or are more influential to just a few, such that there moods impact others greatly.
Again this is perfectly natural, and so is the want for bipolar people to have stable relationships or to live alone. People will tend to be more bipolar when they are in the middle of a storm, internal and especially external, or after recovering from trauma, when they are most sensitive. Bipolar will also be most common when people surround themselves with sensitive people. 
Is it a problem. Normally not, that is not if there is a logical reason for the mood swings. Then what is most needed is understanding and not Labelling or worry. Will drugs solve the problem, potentially by numbing the person to the trauma/ storm and more ironically by easing the fears of most around the moody individual. 

Narcissism, tends to be confused for individualisation.
