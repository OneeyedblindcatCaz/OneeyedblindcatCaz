Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love

When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted

If it's love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night.
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love.

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe


5G has arrived,  a new world probably is coming. But the issue that I am adament gets ignored by the news companies, governments and more importantly 5G producers like Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm, are it's safety and impact on our happiness from a scientific angle.

There are four massive lines of thought here. One is to do with machinery, surveillance and governmental weapons. The second is to do with health such as diabetes, obesity and influenza. The third is to do with mother-earth, bee colonies and plankton.

The fourth more subjective, less scientific debate is to do with jobs, as we entertainment vs entrainment debating whether the obvious benefits to 5g are actually harmful to our independence and happiness, making 5G a trojan horse gift to the public from the scientists and corporate bodies who will make a killing.

Starting with the biggie, nature, electricity has always been a force to play with. The chinese book written in the fourth century B.C. called 'Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine' understood that 'Qu' was elecricity and that 'Yin' and 'Yang' are negative and positive (as like electric charges - 'The pure Yang forms the heaven and the turbid Yin forms the earth.

The Qi of the ascends and turns into clouds while the Qi of the heaven descends and turns into rain. Weather and therefore electrically sensitive-individuals include Charles Darwin, Benejamin Franklin, Dante, Geothe, Victor Hugo, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Mozart, Napoleon, Rosseau and Voltaire to name a few. 

Newton described Electricity as 'an electric and elastic spirit' by which 'all sensation is excited and the member of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by the vibrations of this spirit, mutually propogaed along the solid filaments of the nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain into the muscles'.

whilst Gorrilaz sang about the power of love and electricity, in the Island of Wight 1904, the bee population was hit by electricity. This is almost a certainty for in the preceding decade Gustavo Marconi decided to build the world first radio station by the needles, having given no consideration at all to the safety precautions of his feat. 

This is in spite of the fact a decade before a reputed physician, director of the laboratory of biological physics at the Collège de France in Paris had tested similar high frequency sine waves on human subjects and found that 'with very steady sine waves, nerve and muscle are not stimulated... The 

The passage of the current nevertheless is responsible for profound modification of metabolism as shown by the consumption of a greater amount of oxygen and the production of considerably more carbon dioxide. If the shape of the wave is changed, each electrical wave will produce a muscular contraction... Currents (similar to radio waves broadcasted from the Island of White) penatrate deeply into the organism (humans)”2

In essence it changed the oxygen, co2 and metabolism on humans, quite a big deal. What effect would it have on smaller animals such as bees and Marconi?  


Regarding health, anxiety disorder, influenza, diabetes, heart disease and cancer were all diseases that didnt plague humanity at all before electricity became a mainstay between the 1860s and 1900s. Yes dietary changes and culture has been blamed but taking cancer for example, it is known even tobacco smoking in non-electrified times did not cause lung cancer.
