Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love

When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted

If it's love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night.
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love.

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe


5G has arrived,  a new world probably is coming. But the issue that I am adament gets ignored by the news companies, governments and more importantly 5G producers like Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm, are it's safety and impact on our happiness from a scientific angle.

There are four massive lines of thought here. One is to do with machinery, surveillance and governmental weapons. The second is to do with health such as diabetes, obesity and influenza. The third is to do with mother-earth, bee colonies and plankton.

The fourth more subjective, less scientific debate is to do with jobs, as we entertainment vs entrainment debating whether the obvious benefits to 5g are actually harmful to our independence and happiness, making 5G a trojan horse gift to the public from the scientists and corporate bodies who will make a killing.

Starting with nature, whilst Gorrilaz sang about the power of love and electricity, in the Island of Wight 1904, the bee population was hit by electricity. This is almost a certainty for in the preceding decade Gustavo Marconi decided to build the world first radio station by the needles, having given no consideration at all to the safety precautions of his feat. 

This is in spite of the fact a decade before a reputed physician, director of the laboratory of biological physics at the Collège de France in Paris had tested similar high frequency sine waves on human subjects and found that 'with very steady sine waves, nerve and muscle are not stimulated.

The passage of the current nevertheless is responsible for profound modification of metabolism as shown by the consumption of a greater amount of oxygen and the production of considerably more carbon dioxide. If the shape of the wave is changed, each electrical wave will produce a muscular contraction.”2

In essence it changed the oxygen, co2 and metabolism on humans, quite a big deal. What effect would it have on smaller animals such as bees?
