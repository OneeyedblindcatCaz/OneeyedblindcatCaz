Misgiving

'Take care with the statements you make, 
and the stance you take,

One way to counteract guilt is to believe in luck and chance as a major factor in our lives. This way we dissolve our egos which falls for extremes. 
Take for instance personal finance. The best behavioural economists have shown already that luck and
