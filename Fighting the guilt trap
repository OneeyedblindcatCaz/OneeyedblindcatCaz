Misgiving

'Take care with the statements you make, 
and the stance you take, 
think it through, 
for your steel and hardness, 
will feel like heart and darkness, 

whilst your softness and kindness, 
may be exploited and taken for granted. 
And the more words you say, 
the more you'll pay, 
and more threateningly, the more likely you'll get your way'.

The guilt trap comes in all forms, it particarly rises from the games people play. 
But rather than analysing its forms, let's analyse the feeling. 
The feeling is 'you're not good enough', you are this or that and it's not fleeting. 
It's a sticky feeling, one to always hold you back, for guilt brings shame that you are different and weaker.
What triggers it is low understanding, as in unconstructive criticism of yourself by yourself or others. 
That's why being misgiving is not such a bad thing at all, for the solution to guilt is care and self-defence (just not excessive pride). 

Here's the truth, people are made to feel guilty because others are already hurting.
It's always a 'you can't - be, do, have, say' because 'you are this or that'. 
It's repugnant. 
I'm not defending unrepetance, nor advocating for happy shiny people, merely that being misgiving with criticism and praise is best. 

In truth,
