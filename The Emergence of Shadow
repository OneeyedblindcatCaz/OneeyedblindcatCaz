Misgiving

'Take care with the statements you make, 
and the stance you take, 
think it through, 
for your steel and hardness, 
will feel like heart and darkness, 

whilst your softness and kindness, 
may be exploited and taken for granted. 
And the more words you say, 
the more you'll pay, 
and more threateningly, the more likely you'll get your way'.
