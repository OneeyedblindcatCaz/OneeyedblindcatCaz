Misplaced Trust

We search to meet up with those who we can share a sense of trust;
It puts our shoulders back and makes us bolder,
feeds warmth into our hearts 

The internet is cold , but yet trusted the most,
so hurt are we by other's vices,

And we are forced to work so hard,
like snakes and sharks ,
in a corporate hurrah,
to feel safe and warm in our hearts

and follow a dream,
to meet up with our kin
and celebrate online
how a robot lives.

Let me counteract the poem, and say the internet is amazing, so is the information age and it most certainly can help us be more widely social. But it has a downside and one of the issues with 5g is that downside will be amplified.
