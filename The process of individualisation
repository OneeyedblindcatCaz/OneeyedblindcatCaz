I Am                                                                            I am                                               On a Columnar Self—
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In Tumult—or Extremity— How ample to rely
I know not whither I go                                              I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;                      On a Columnar Self-
But the fact stands clear that I am here                             My friends forsake me like a memory lost:                    How ample to rely
In this world of pleasure and woe.                                   I am the self-consumer of my woes—                           In Tumult or Extremity
And out of the mist and murk,                                        They rise and vanish in oblivious host,                      How Good the certainty
Another truth shines plain.                                          Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes               That Lever cannot pry-
It is in my power each day and hour                                  And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed                   And Wedge cannot divide
To add to its joy or its pain.
I know that the earth exists,                                        Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,                     Conviction - That Granatic Base-
It is none of my business why.                                       Into the living sea of waking dreams,                        Though none be on our side-
I cannot find out what it’s all about,                               Where there is neither sense of life or joys,                Suffice Us- for a Crowd
I would but waste time to try.                                       But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems;                 Ourselves - And rectitude-
My life is a brief, brief thing,                                     Even the dearest that I loved the best                       And that assembly - not far off
I am here for a little space.                                        Are strange—nay, rather, stranger than the rest.             From furthest spirit - God-
And while I stay I would like, if I may,
To brighten and better the place.                                    I long for scenes where man hath never trod                  Emily Dickinson
                                                                     A place where woman never smiled or wept
The trouble, I think, with us all                                    There to abide with my Creator, God,
Is the lack of a high conceit.                                       And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,
If each man thought he was sent to this spot                         Untroubling and untroubled where I lie
To make it a bit more sweet,                                         The grass below — above the vaulted sky.
How soon we could gladden the world,
How easily right all wrong.                                          John Clare
If nobody shirked, and each one worked
To help his fellows along.
Cease wondering why you came–
Stop looking for faults and flaws.
Rise up to day in your pride and say,
“I am part of the First Great Cause!
However full the world
There is room for an earnest man.
It had need of me or I would not be,
I am here to strengthen the plan.”

Ella Wheeler Wilcox


The I am is really a question, and it is one which is never fully answerable and yet one which we are always carrying an answer to. Hence, we are always really in a process of individualisation. 

The bigger question is where do you take that question.

Ella Wheeler Wilcox takes the most simple stance to answering the I am question in her poem. She stresses upon the importance of positivy and high conceit, that it a degree of vanity and humility, and actually to matter in the world.

She essentially grasps the concept that there are always two side to every person, and leans to the generous side of aiming to be always being strictly loving and positive to the self, to stop looking for faults and flaws.

As she still stresses on having well founded pride and vanity, but not through working through your flaws and weaknesses, she is essentially advocating the most simple of ways to answer this question.

I regard that she is advising everyone to stay at what they are good at, therby making the world that bit sweeter and to never waste time, for every hour matters. 

She is highly against self-absorpiton, besides looking after your space and yourself, she actually demands that everyone should work to help others, and cease wondering why they are here and thinking about the technicalities of the earth.

This is the most humane, literate but anti-scientific answer I think that can be expressed. It is no doubt noble and coincides with Emily Dickinson's poem where she praises what is to her a columner self.

Dickinson stresses we need that conviction and rectitude in are lives, and it is these the morals and our sense of self-worth that lets us pass through unscaved like a column the extemes and difficulties of life, and prevents us from being victims of circumstance or the crowd mentality.

The poem's finishing note highlights that this way a person comes closer to that far-off concept of god, which parellels the finishing touch of Ella Wheeler's poem that we are here 'to strengthen the plan'.

John Clare also is longing for god but has a totally different take of answering the I am question for it is clear he longs for peacefullness, solitaryness and innocence. 

I percieve that he is really longing for fairness and time, and he closes to god through this search for a fair finality to him, which is a completely fresh start and compensation really for all the scars and hardness that life has made him endure.

It seems clear he has apreciation for the past and that he was born and raised in this world with such serenity that he wants to hold onto it, but by contrast to Ella Wheeler's poem his answer is much more nostalgic and sadly reflective than positive and campaigning.

He gives off the impression that answering the I am question is the most important question, and that others neglect his need for being understood and apreciated as indivuals. Even his loved ones are strangers and his friends let him down. 

He is openly pious and self-pitying about how he much has lost externally in life, and how little understanding he sees in others, but he treasures the fact that he knows himself to have had more. His goal appears to be to recreate this feeling, which he likens to sweetly dreaming.

Where his poem coincides with Emily Dickinson is that he is searching for God, but he emphasises that it is his creator, that God is his and accessible when alone. He is not the column for he is most troubled by others, but yet he convinces us he persists - his I am still lives - depsite having lost all self-esteems.

Whilst all three writer's advocate to take the I am question seriously, John comes across as the person who takes it most personally. His poem is paradoxically the least instructive and yet most cynical, the most relaxed and yet troubled, and from this I gather that the crux of what he really wants to express is that there is joy from being yourself which you cannot get with others. 


Taking the question from a more logical angle and looking further into what is the proccess of individualisation, it is important to pay attention to how we are designed to handle the I am question cognitively. 

We know through science that our brains work best with metaphors, symbols and archetypes for they bring pictures, movies and ideas into our minds. We are drawn to stories and if you study memory, you will find all the experts of memory use visual techniques in order to be able rememember complex number sequences.

That is just how our brains are wired, just as we are wired to find these names and words that embody our most important qualities- This is the process Carl Jung called individualisation and it is labelling.

Thus when going through the proccess of individualisation, you will find that through whatever means, the I is really a we, cloaked in cosmic consciousness, and a fictional we at that for it comes from our ideas of others,.

This is down to our innate need to compare and learn from others and to relate. It is other people who give you your character and taste, by giving you the chance to react to them, and we are constantly filtering through other people's thoughts as we ride the waves of life.

There is a huge anti-I movement which is really mistaken by people for negating our individuality. However, really the movement is just simplyfying what I really means by showing that the I to be just the ideas, the essence, the natural instincts inside us which drives our reactions to the environment.  

Thus, when we are forced to overadjust to unpleasant circumstances, experiences there lies that need in us to readjust back to what we call ourselves, which in reality was the I in us that was comfortable in our surroundings.

This shows why during an awakening or a period of self-reflection time, is it important to maximise the process and cause least offence through comparision and to not get lost in the 'you are' mentality, when it's all really a metaphor. The question of whether we are all actors or simply re-actors is really a chicken and egg story, but together they bring about the most important aspect to perfect the life. 

That is the fact that we are actors/re-actors shows how important it is for us to work on reacting to criticism, praise and non-judgment, as much as how we act towards each other. To have perfect actions but bad reactions is a flawed way of being, likewise visa-versa.

This is why there's art and always a need for art, for it's what helps us find ourselves the most through expression, imagary and metaphors, without the harshness of other's judgements and to develop our own taste.

Going more abstract, our dreams and sensory abilities play an important role, for that is what subconcious often is reflected through or busy deciphering the world via. In that sense, what your reactions or actions really are - what you really are, minus the impact of your environment - are your six senses, which helps you decipher your environments (including auras and the etherial and astral environment).

But the collective consciousness is just as important part of us as our sensory and genetic abilities and for that reason poets talk about causes and artists about caring for one another.

The fact is metaphors, symbols and archetypes will become labels and they ought to be therefore generally fun, tongue in cheek and/or self-effacing or lightening. Of course, some hard labels can be useful but the dark side of the label is all to apparent to everyone.

What is usual is for us to build an identity or an act if you like, and when something crops up which challanges it, to find a coping mechanism or learn a new way to react or even set of reactions which doesn't change our identity, but merely adds to it. 

Generally only from being shook to the core do we ever want to complete readjust and think about all parts of ourselves, but that is bound to happen unless you are extremely fortunately raised. This is really natural and why its always important to have certain liberty to be able to live alone if neccessary.

And it's not going to be always a pleasent journey, going through the proccess of individualisation. We are not perfect even if we are fine.

Dale Carnegie, one of the world's most famous and respected salesmans, writers and self-improvers stated that "when we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves.”

Moreover, when talking, people talk about themselves well over half the time on average, and on social media even closer to 100% than 50% according to science.

And people suffer horrendously and frankly positively (it is a self-survival trait) from the Dunning-Kruger effect which is now termed as illusory Superiorit. 

It's not just that, now everyone is stuck in cities and they are living with crowd pressure/ emotional contagion, and even when away from cities they are still being influenced by others through social media.

There is a double-edged sword as poor performers are genuinely less able at distinguishing between good and bad performances, and we're all poor performers at something, and then with all the misinformation and false confidence being passed around it's almost impossible to not be slightly delusional.

This is shown really clearly by the fact most people overestimate their IQ with there being a little correlation between how low a persons IQ was and the more they overestimate it. 

Generally though this is due to the fact people are misinformed and its better to be confident in life. In fact, the man who most populated this belief through scientific study - Dr. Dunning himself informed that the effect “has more to do with being misinformed rather than uninformed.”

What is more obvious is that people overestimate themselves at work when sadly coworkers are probably better than they are at analysing their job performance. Most think they're better at their job than their peers.

And most shown by studies is that drivers consistently rate themselves as better than average, with some studies showing 90% of drivers think they are above average.


By contrast, we really do know according to studies our emotions and mental stability the best, though others often think they know better.

This is exactly why labels related to mental health are particularly hazardous and likely to shake us, because ironically whilst labels are meant to improve our mental health in the process of individualisation, in reality current mental health labels are normally the most damaging force lowering people's self-esteem and causing unneccessary baggage. 

I have my own thoughts of how various mental labels get confused and I will share. 

For instance- autism is I believe the most often confused mainstream label. What I've noticed from being in this world is that whilst people obviously have radically different thinking styles (e.g. top-down and bottom-up/ thinking in circles and squarehead thinking), people are more polarised and quick to judge their opposites, probably because there types of thinkers are being exessively judged themselves.

In other words, emotional contagioun is destroying our ability to judge.

It is clear autism exists and there is a spectrum, but it is only those who are extremely autistic who are the ones who should get positively labelled by specialists and lets be honest that really would depend on which specialist you would see, so probably the label should only be taken seriously if someone's seen multiple. 

However, sadly I am certain that almost everyone will be seen by another person from a different line/ way of thinking as potentially autistic, so this word became one of the most overused words. 

My main belief is that autism is used mostly by people lossely as an argumentative tool where those who disagree particularly over the style someone argues with them is most compelled to throw the A word. 

The other overused A word I believe in circulation is ADHD, which is confused for being bored, and my recommendation is to resist the temptation to worry about these words. They're trash.

The whole popular mental health industry with their dozens of terms has become a labelling joke and this is what is going to trouble those who want to think independently and away from the crowd.

I think science really shows that we really do know ourselves emotionally the best and should just follow the artists in general, and experts in phycology, philosophy and life-gurus, but with work - trust others.
