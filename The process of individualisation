I Am                                                                            I am                                               On a Columnar Self—
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In Tumult—or Extremity— How ample to rely
I know not whither I go                                              I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;                      On a Columnar Self-
But the fact stands clear that I am here                             My friends forsake me like a memory lost:                    How ample to rely
In this world of pleasure and woe.                                   I am the self-consumer of my woes—                           In Tumult or Extremity
And out of the mist and murk,                                        They rise and vanish in oblivious host,                      How Good the certainty
Another truth shines plain.                                          Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes               That Lever cannot pry-
It is in my power each day and hour                                  And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed                   And Wedge cannot divide
To add to its joy or its pain.
I know that the earth exists,                                        Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,                     Conviction - That Granatic Base-
It is none of my business why.                                       Into the living sea of waking dreams,                        Though none be on our side-
I cannot find out what it’s all about,                               Where there is neither sense of life or joys,                Suffice Us- for a Crowd
I would but waste time to try.                                       But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems;                 Ourselves - And rectitude-
My life is a brief, brief thing,                                     Even the dearest that I loved the best                       And that assembly - not far off
I am here for a little space.                                        Are strange—nay, rather, stranger than the rest.             From furthest spirit - God-
And while I stay I would like, if I may,
To brighten and better the place.                                    I long for scenes where man hath never trod                  Emily Dickinson
                                                                     A place where woman never smiled or wept
The trouble, I think, with us all                                    There to abide with my Creator, God,
Is the lack of a high conceit.                                       And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,
If each man thought he was sent to this spot                         Untroubling and untroubled where I lie
To make it a bit more sweet,                                         The grass below — above the vaulted sky.
How soon we could gladden the world,
How easily right all wrong.                                          John Clare
If nobody shirked, and each one worked
To help his fellows along.
Cease wondering why you came–
Stop looking for faults and flaws.
Rise up to day in your pride and say,
“I am part of the First Great Cause!
However full the world
There is room for an earnest man.
It had need of me or I would not be,
I am here to strengthen the plan.”

Ella Wheeler Wilcox


The I am is really a question, and it is one which is never fully answerable and yet one which we are always carrying an answer to. Hence, we are always really in a process of individualisation. 

The bigger question is where do you take that question.

Ella Wheeler Wilcox takes the most simple stance to answering the I am question in her poem. She stresses upon the importance of positivy and high conceit, that it a degree of vanity and humility, and actually to matter in the world.

She essentially grasps the concept that there are always two side to every person, and leans to the generous side of aiming to be always being strictly loving and positive to the self, to stop looking for faults and flaws.

As she still stresses on having well founded pride and vanity, but not through working through your flaws and weaknesses, she is essentially advocating the most simple of ways to answer this question.

I regard that she is advising everyone to stay at what they are good at, therby making the world that bit sweeter and to never waste time, for every hour matters. 

She is highly against self-absorpiton, besides looking after your space and yourself, she actually demands that everyone should work to help others, and cease wondering why they are here and thinking about the technicalities of the earth.

This is the most humane, literate but anti-scientific answer I think that can be expressed. It is no doubt noble and coincides with Emily Dickinson's poem where she praises what is to her a columner self.

Dickinson stresses we need that conviction and rectitude in are lives, and it is these the morals and our sense of self-worth that lets us pass through unscaved like a column the extemes and difficulties of life, and prevents us from being victims of circumstance or the crowd mentality.

The poem's finishing note highlights that this way a person comes closer to that far-off concept of god, which parellels the finishing touch of Ella Wheeler's poem that we are here 'to strengthen the plan'.

John Clare also is longing for god but has a totally different take of answering the I am question for it is clear he longs for peacefullness, solitaryness and innocence. 

I percieve that he is really longing for fairness and time, and he closes to god through this search for a fair finality to him, which is a completely fresh start and compensation really for all the scars and hardness that life has made him endure.

It seems clear he has apreciation for the past and that he was born and raised in this world with such serenity that he wants to hold onto it, but by contrast to Ella Wheeler's poem his answer is much more nostalgic and sadly reflective than positive and campaigning.

He gives off the impression that answering the I am question is the most important question, and that others neglect his need for being understood and apreciated as indivuals. Even his loved ones are strangers and his friends let him down. 

He is openly pious and self-pitying about how he much has lost externally in life, and how little understanding he sees in others, but he treasures the fact that he knows himself to have had more. His goal appears to be to recreate this feeling, which he likens to sweetly dreaming.

Where his poem coincides with Emily Dickinson is that he is searching for God, but he emphasises that it is his creator, that God is his and accessible when alone. He is not the column for he is most troubled by others, but yet he convinces us he persists - his I am still lives - depsite having lost all self-esteems.

Whilst all three writer's advocate to take the I am question seriously, John comes across as the person who takes it most personally. His poem is paradoxically the least instructive and yet most cynical, the most relaxed and yet troubled, and from this I gather that the crux of what he really wants to express is that there is joy from being yourself which you cannot get with others. 

Taking the question from a more logical angle, it is important how we are designed to handle the question cognitively. Our brains work best with metaphors, symbols and archetypes for they bring pictures, movies and ideas into our minds. We are drawn to stories and if you study memory, you will find all the experts of memory use visual techniques in order to be able rememember complex number sequences.

That is how our brains are wired, just as we are wired to find these names and words that embody our most important qualities- This is the process Carl Jung called individualisation and it is labelling.

Thus when going through the proccess of individualisation, you will find that through whatever means, the I is really a we, cloaked in cosmic consciousness, and a fictional we at that for it comes from our ideas of others,.

This is down to our innate need to compare and learn from others and to relate. It is other people who give you your character and taste, by giving you the chance to react to them, and we are constantly filtering through other people's thoughts as we ride the waves of life.

There is a huge anti-I movement which is really mistaken by people, showing that the I to be just the ideas, the essence, the natural instincts which drive our reactions to the environment.  Yet that is no doubt as important to understand as the we, and what we generall





However, if during an awakening or a period of self-reflection time you decide to look deeper at yourself than your friends circle, is it important to maximise the process and cause least offence through comparision, however hard that is and this is done generally through works of art. Music is obvious, so is art and literature and film with a million characters to let sink into your subconscious.

Going more abstract, our dreams and sensory abilities play an important role. Deciphering our auras, deciphering our subconcious, deciphering the etherial and astral parts of ourselves.

The fact is metaphors, symbols and archetypes will become labels and they ought to be therefore generally fun, tongue in cheek and/or self-effacing or lightening. Of course, some hard labels can be useful but the dark side of the label is all to apparent to everyone.

I myself consider myself a circular thinker, it means with me you will have to deal with doubting and going round in circles and roundabouts, etc. On the other hand, blockheads are more straigh, less confused but equally more conventional . These are fine labels for me, it's important to understand how you think so you can manage yourself well and carve the right life for you.

It is arguable we don't exist as and I, that we are just nothing but ideas, this is what the likes of Jim Carrey and William Shakespear believe, and they have a point, on the hand we are definitely united and therefore are we seperately indivuals; equally given how changable we are who's to say we are more us sober than drunk when our inhibitions are down (I am of the belief we are more us sober because we are more complete) but the point is the situation changes us, makeing us actors.

What is usual is for us to build an identity or an act if you like, and when something crops up which challanges it, to find a coping mechanism or learn a new set reaction and grow our identity, add another aspect to ourselves. 

What can happen is we can be shook, and probably should be shook from time to time, so much that we have to complete readjust and think about all the parts of us, or we will never be over what has shook us. This is really natural and why its always important to have certain liberty to be able to live alone if neccessary.

We are not perfect. Dale Carnegie, one of the world's most famous and respected salesmans, writers and self-improvers stated that "When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves.”

When talking, people talk about themselves well over half the time on average, and on social media even closer to 100% than 50% according to science.


Labels related to mental health are particularly hazardous and likely to shake us, because ironically whilst labels are meant to improve our mental health in the process of individualisation, actually current mental health labels are normally the most damaging force lowering people's self-esteem. 

I have my own thoughts of how various mental labels get confused and I will share. 

For instance- autism is I believe the most often confused mainstream label. What I've noticed from being in this world is that people have radically different thinking styles, for instance there are top-down thinkers and those who specialise in bottom -up thinking, just like there are those who think in circles and those who think more squarely. 

It is clear autism exists and there is a spectrum, but it is only those who are extremely autistic are the ones who should get labelled by specialists and that really depend on which specialist you see, so probably the label should only be taken seriously if two 

However, sadly almost everyone will be seen by another person, 
from a different line or simply different way of thinking as potentially autistic, so this word became one of the most overused words. My main belief is that autism is used mostly by people lossely as an argumentative tool.
Those who disagree particularly over the style someone argues with them is most compelled to throw the A word. The other overused A word I believe in circulation is ADHD and my recommendation is to resist the temptation to worry about these words unless a specialist tells you.
