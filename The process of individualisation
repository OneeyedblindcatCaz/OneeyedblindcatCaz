I Am                                                                            I am                                               On a Columnar Self—
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I know not whence I came,                                                                                                         In Tumult—or Extremity— How ample to rely
I know not whither I go                                              I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;                      On a Columnar Self-
But the fact stands clear that I am here                             My friends forsake me like a memory lost:                    How ample to rely
In this world of pleasure and woe.                                   I am the self-consumer of my woes—                           In Tumult or Extremity
And out of the mist and murk,                                        They rise and vanish in oblivious host,                      How Good the certainty
Another truth shines plain.                                          Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes               That Lever cannot pry-
It is in my power each day and hour                                  And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed                   And Wedge cannot divide
To add to its joy or its pain.
I know that the earth exists,                                        Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,                     Conviction - That Granatic Base-
It is none of my business why.                                       Into the living sea of waking dreams,                        Though none be on our side-
I cannot find out what it’s all about,                               Where there is neither sense of life or joys,                Suffice Us- for a Crowd
I would but waste time to try.                                       But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems;                 Ourselves - And rectitude-
My life is a brief, brief thing,                                     Even the dearest that I loved the best                       And that assembly - not far off
I am here for a little space.                                        Are strange—nay, rather, stranger than the rest.             From furthest spirit - God-
And while I stay I would like, if I may,
To brighten and better the place.                                    I long for scenes where man hath never trod                  Emily Dickinson
                                                                     A place where woman never smiled or wept
The trouble, I think, with us all                                    There to abide with my Creator, God,
Is the lack of a high conceit.                                       And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,
If each man thought he was sent to this spot                         Untroubling and untroubled where I lie
To make it a bit more sweet,                                         The grass below—above the vaulted sky.
How soon we could gladden the world,
How easily right all wrong.                                          John Clare
If nobody shirked, and each one worked
To help his fellows along.
Cease wondering why you came–
Stop looking for faults and flaws.
Rise up to day in your pride and say,
“I am part of the First Great Cause!
However full the world
There is room for an earnest man.
It had need of me or I would not be,
I am here to strengthen the plan.”

Ella Wheeler Wilcox


Who are we? Who am I?

These are the questions that run deep within us, and given 











Our brains work best with metaphors, symbols and archetypes for they bring pictures, movies and ideas into our minds. If you study memory, you will find all the experts of memory use visual techniques in order to be able rememember complex number sequences, equations and even cards. There's a reason why people are drawn to stories

stereotypically more than dry maths. Labelling ourselves and finding names that embody our most important qualities is a process Carl Jung called individualisation.

Thus when discovering yourself, you will find that through whatever means, the I plays an important role, as our innate need to compare and learn from others. Having heroes and equally aversions to people gives you character.

However, if during an awakening or a period of self-reflection time you decide to look deeper at yourself than your friends circle, is it important to maximise the process and cause least offence through comparision, however hard that is and this is done generally through works of art. Music is obvious, so is art and literature and film with a million characters to let sink into your subconscious.

Going more abstract, our dreams and sensory abilities play an important role. Deciphering our auras, deciphering our subconcious, deciphering the etherial and astral parts of ourselves.

The fact is metaphors, symbols and archetypes will become labels and they ought to be therefore generally fun, tongue in cheek and/or self-effacing or lightening. Of course, some hard labels can be useful but the dark side of the label is all to apparent to everyone.

I myself consider myself a circular thinker, it means with me you will have to deal with doubting and going round in circles and roundabouts, etc. On the other hand, blockheads are more straigh, less confused but equally more conventional . These are fine labels for me, it's important to understand how you think so you can manage yourself well and carve the right life for you.

It is arguable we don't exist as and I, that we are just nothing but ideas, this is what the likes of Jim Carrey and William Shakespear believe, and they have a point, on the hand we are definitely united and therefore are we seperately indivuals; equally given how changable we are who's to say we are more us sober than drunk when our inhibitions are down (I am of the belief we are more us sober because we are more complete) but the point is the situation changes us, makeing us actors.

What is usual is for us to build an identity or an act if you like, and when something crops up which challanges it, to find a coping mechanism or learn a new set reaction and grow our identity, add another aspect to ourselves. 

What can happen is we can be shook, and probably should be shook from time to time, so much that we have to complete readjust and think about all the parts of us, or we will never be over what has shook us. This is really natural and why its always important to have certain liberty to be able to live alone if neccessary.

We are not perfect. Dale Carnegie, one of the world's most famous and respected salesmans, writers and self-improvers stated that "When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves.”

When talking, people talk about themselves well over half the time on average, and on social media even closer to 100% than 50% according to science.


Labels related to mental health are particularly hazardous and likely to shake us, because ironically whilst labels are meant to improve our mental health in the process of individualisation, actually current mental health labels are normally the most damaging force lowering people's self-esteem. 

I have my own thoughts of how various mental labels get confused and I will share. 

For instance- autism is I believe the most often confused mainstream label. What I've noticed from being in this world is that people have radically different thinking styles, for instance there are top-down thinkers and those who specialise in bottom -up thinking, just like there are those who think in circles and those who think more squarely. 

It is clear autism exists and there is a spectrum, but it is only those who are extremely autistic are the ones who should get labelled by specialists and that really depend on which specialist you see, so probably the label should only be taken seriously if two 

However, sadly almost everyone will be seen by another person, 
from a different line or simply different way of thinking as potentially autistic, so this word became one of the most overused words. My main belief is that autism is used mostly by people lossely as an argumentative tool.
Those who disagree particularly over the style someone argues with them is most compelled to throw the A word. The other overused A word I believe in circulation is ADHD and my recommendation is to resist the temptation to worry about these words unless a specialist tells you.
