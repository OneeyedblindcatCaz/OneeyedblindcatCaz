'The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical.
It is the sower of all true science.
He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe,
is as good as dead'.


The practice of shamanism helps to reestablish the "seeing" (our sixth sense or intuition), which is an important part of our ability to survive.
Seeing is not linear nor logical. It communicates to us in symbols through poetry and idioms, and in body language, colors, shapes, smells and bodily sensations.'
