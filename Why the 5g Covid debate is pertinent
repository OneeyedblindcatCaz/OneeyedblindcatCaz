5g is around the corner and I believe it will reshape society, although hopefully only for the better. 

But the issue that I am adament gets ignored by the news companies, governments and more importantly 5g producers like Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm, that is companies like Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm is its safety and impact on our happiness from a scientific angle.

There are four massive lines of thought here. One is to do with machinery, surveillance and governmental weapons. The second is to do with health such as diabetes, obesity and influenza. The third is to do with our nature, bee colonies and plankton. The fourth is to do with jobs, entertainment vs entrainment debating whether the obvious benefits to 5g are actually harmful, making 5g a trojan horse gift to the public from the scientists and corporate bodies.
