Biologicals injurous

It has been shown by the research of Dr Burdon Sanderson back in 1868 that tuberculosis often followed the inoculation of animals with various materials (mostly biological) from non-tubercular sources, and that in fact, any wound might be followed by tuberculosis ('On the Inoculability and Development of Tubercles'). 

Biologicals include vaccines, allergenics, somatic cells, and types of gene, blood, and protein therapies. The question that has been raised is do vaccines cause 'acute miliary tuberculosis’ (TB), a fatal 2-4 week disease that occurs generally in those under 15, and those with HIV.

He (rightly, I believe) considers pulmonary tuberculosis to be at least in part ‘and to a greater or less extent’ a septicemia, and adds:

“The failure of vaccines to affect the disease in any but an adverse manner is thus explained. As we all know, vaccines have invariably been found useless or worse than useless in septicemias.”

As occurred with ‘flu’ in the war, which was merely a mutation of the typhoid germ in the vaccines used against typhoid and paratyphoid, every vaccine may produce a ‘new’ form of germ which, as noted above, may ‘make the occurrence of the disease much more marked than previously’.

Vaccines - all causes, heart disease, brights disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer, smallpox, diptheria, scarlet fever, croup

The Agricochemical and Agricultural industry is not much better than the pharmaceutical companies.
