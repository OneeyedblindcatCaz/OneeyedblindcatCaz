Bitcoin is the new technology, founded by Satoshi, that will rise. The way trust flows through society is changing from hierarchical and institutional based trust to a more peer-to-peer and heterarchical trust, a gradual change over centuries in Western Civilisation, that has now accelerated enormously in the last decades as a result of the Internet. 

Reviews, rating sites, blogs, friends and colleagues are now firmly new sources of trust that are relied on, whilst the media, government and powerful institutions, such as banks, are now widely and ever-increasingly mistrusted for great reasons!

The 2007 Financial Crisis perfectly illustrates how vulnerable the economy is when powerful institutions make mistakes, and certainly led to a drastic fall in the publicâ€™s trust of banks. 

Bitcoin will in all likelihood be accepted by governments and society as the most effective means of payment and the most common form of payment. 

What this means is that the economy would be undoubtedly revolutionised in two fundamental ways: on a macro-level, it would replace monetary policy and facilitate fiscal policy, whilst on a micro-level, it would increase consumer-power and decrease producer-power.

Bitcoin can revolutionise economics through decentralisation, thereby taking away power from institutions that can no longer be trusted.

That is Satoshi's vision.
