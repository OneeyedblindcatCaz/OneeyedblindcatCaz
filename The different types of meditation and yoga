Apathy

Top heavy and lacking energy,
your body pierced and aching in lethargy,
a wise friend gone mad,
both nagging and knowing,
work it out,
without large doubts,
tempting as it may be,
to be a layabout

Your heart will prevent apathy,
as your head groans and doubts,
Your heart can relate,
because aches wehn respected,
helps your balance, not aims,
yourself knows this is suffice.
