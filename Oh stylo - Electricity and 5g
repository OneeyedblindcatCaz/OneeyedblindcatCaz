Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted
If it's love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night.
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now
Sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love.
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe
