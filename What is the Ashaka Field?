MEMORY AND TIME

'Time is the strand, 
where all our lives collide, 
where our perceptions
and the reality, 
wander in rhyme. 

It's filled by memories, 
shaping our nature, 
non physical yet violent, 
with their relentless pressure. 

Mastering time is nothing more, 
than entering pandora's box, 
yet not feeling lost, 
but wasting time, 
is like drowning on earth.'


'The akasha field is a sanskrit word meaning ether: all pervasive space. Originally signifying "radiation" or "brilliance" in Indian philosophy akasha was considered the first and most fundamental of the fivve elemens -
the other being vata (air, agni (fire), ap (water) and prithivi (earth). Akasha embraces the properties of all five elements: it is the womb from which everything we percieve with our senses has emerged and into which evverything will ultimately re-descend.
the Akashic Record (also called The Akashic Chronicle,) is the enduring record of all that happens and has ever happened in space and time.' - Irving Lazslo
