Misplaced Trust

We search to meet up with those who we can share a sense of trust;
It puts our shoulders back and makes us bolder,
feeds warmth into our hearts 

The internet is cold , but yet trusted the most,
so hurt are we by other's vices,

And we are forced to work so hard,
like snakes and sharks ,
in a corporate hurrah,
to feel safe and warm in our hearts

and follow a dream,
to meet up with our kin
and celebrate online
how a robot lives.

The reason I write that poem is increasingly obvious. We all spend time on our phones and we miss out on socialising, travelling and frankly loving. 

We even become anti-social on our phones, ghosting people online, and distancing ourselves from others through focusing more on working and internet than actually caring about other's reality. 

The Internet is great for all the obvious reasons, entertainment, information and communication - that's why I'm being slightly hypocritical and writing this post. I'm not advocating for anyone to be a hermit, unless they wanted to.

Just to feed the less corporate, poppy side of the Internet when you do so.

The trust you have in AI is mistrust. Unless you know how to use Linux or don't care about privacy, you should be worried slightly by the fact you are being exploited by the world's leading technocrats. 

The Internet is a black-box. 



Here are some good sites I've found
