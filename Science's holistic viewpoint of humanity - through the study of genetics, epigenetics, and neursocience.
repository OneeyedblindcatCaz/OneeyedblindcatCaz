Science is v

Paradigm shift - accumliationof observations that do not fit the accepeted theorys and therefore science needs new theory innovation.

Still confirmed fables (presently valid even if not eternally true scientific theories) include Charles Darwin's concept that all living species descended from common ancestors.
However, what is often confused is that Drawinian ideas are about fitness of reporduction not survival of the fittest. 
Originally,Darwinists claimed that the genome (which consists of all the genetic information of an organism) was detached from vicissitudes occurring to all other parts of the organism, called the soma. 
Essentially, evolution in their eyes worked through trial and error, as the germ line (genetic information of parents) varied randomly and seperately to the soma, but by chance would fit into the soma which was affected by its environment.
This tenet is mistaken


Another confirmed fable is tht the universe originated in a superfast "inflation" following its explosive birthing in the Big Bang., a theory developed by Guth and Linde.

Thee are a googol amount of universes, that is 10 to the power of a 100.

Potential fables - Everett's"parallel universes hypothesis" relates to Quantum Physics; Schrodinger wave function collapses when a quanta stops being in the superpositionof all its possible states, however Everett states there is no indeterminacy,
each state occupied by the quanta particle is deterministic in itself- simply taking place in a world of its own. When Quanta is measured, there are a number of possibilities of its state,which we percieve only one of - in a seemingly random process of selection.

According to Everett, all possible states of the quantum are realized every time it is measured or observed, they are just not realized in the same world. Thus as there are a googol amount of possiblities for quanta when measured according to devices, there may be a googol amount of universes.

The holographic universe hypothesis advanced by aricle physicists. Entire universe is a hologram. Holograms are three-dimensional representations of objects recorded with a special technique.

A holographic recording consists of the pattern of interference created by two beams of ligths (monochromatic lasers, semitransparent mirrors used for this purpose).

Idea behidn the holographic universe hypothesis is that all the information that constitutes the universe is stored on its periphery, which is a two-dimensional surfac, that reappears inside the universe as three dimesnsions.

Adressess issue of thermodynamics, second law - disorder can never decrease in a closed system.

The cosmos in its totality is a closed system, there is no outside and hence nothing to which which it could be open

If disorder cannot decrease, order - which can be represented as information - cannot increase.

Quantum theory, information that creates or maintains order must be constant, neither increase nor decrease

When matter implodes into a black hole, an enourmous 

Do black holes wipe out information. No because within the black hole there is more room for order and information than at its surface.
