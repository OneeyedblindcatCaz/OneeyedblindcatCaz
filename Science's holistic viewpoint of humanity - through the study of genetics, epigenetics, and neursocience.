Science is v

Drawinian ideas are about fitness of reporduction not survival of the fittest. 
Originally,Darwinists claimed that the genome (which consists of all the genetic information of an organism) was detached from vicissitudes occurring to all other parts of the organism, called the soma. 
Essentially, evolution in their eyes worked through trial and error, as the germ line (genetic information of parents) varied randomly and seperately to the soma, but by chance would fit into the soma which was affected by its environment.
This tenet is mistaken
