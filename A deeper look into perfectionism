Perfection, just a misnomer, 
there is no place for it, 
nor does it exist, 
enemy of good, 
a beast whipping your forehead, 
as cold as ice is. 

And achieving perfection, 
as an ends rather than a means, 
must be an impersonal venture, 
for people will always stand in the way;

An affliction to cause all trouble, worry and doubt, 
so that you can share nothing with no-one, 
for risk of losing what you have built. 

Perfection, just a misnomer, driving all our bones
A great act, a creation perhaps of kindness, 
the point to which we register everything
is one looking for a relief from living. 

A beauty beast, that whilst fictional, 
serves as the real anti-dote to life.
