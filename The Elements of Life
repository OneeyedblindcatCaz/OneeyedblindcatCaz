This being the most basic subject discussed in the blog, 
is by far the most important. 

The elements of life are our very being. 

There are four main ones - fire (tejas), prana (air), earth  and air (both ojas). 

Then there are the elemental forces driving us - electricity, magnetisism and if we go further, quanta. 

The more you study eastern, western, ancient and modern scientific knowledge in these 6 topics the more personal power 
you may attain and the more the world may open up to you. It goes without saying that you will understand the world greater, 
though the world opening itself up to you may make you have to restructure everything and detach yourself. 



All our words for all portant energy is from other countries - chi - Chinese, prana - sanskrit, ki - Japanese

















The elements under vipassana

Fire, earth, air and water,
Back to the elements we resort. 

Crazy, heavy, flaky, sad,
emotions that are
neither good nor bad

Evening each other
through necessary contrast
so that

hot, strong, light and suave
feelings of home start to flow
from which grows the appreciation of the past.
