Time is the strand, 
where all our lives collide, 
where our perceptions
and the reality, 
wander in rhyme. 

It's filled by memories, 
shaping our nature, 
non physical yet violent, 
with their relentless pressure. 

Mastering time is nothing more, 
than entering pandora's box, 
yet not feeling lost, 
but wasting time, 
is like drowning on earth.
