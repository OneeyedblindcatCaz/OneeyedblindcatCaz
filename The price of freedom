Another economics blog for you. The price of freedom - taking into account of account the views of Friedman, Smith, Keynes, Veblen Rajatnaram and Hayek.

Milton Freedman wrote ‘Our minds tell us, and history confirms, that the great threat to freedom is the concentration of power’ and literally millions of people are involved in providing one another with their daily bread, let alone with their yearly automobiles. The challenge to the believer in liberty is to reconcile this widespread interdependence with individual freedom’  He believed ‘Economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom’ , however following my research I carry different thoughts. First of all, I do not believe pure economic freedom exists, on a practical sense that is for mere humans; not everything can be brought and not everything can be valued. 
Friedman also wrote ‘if economic power is kept in separate hands from political power, it can serve as a check and a counter to political power’  and ‘the tyranny of the status quo is enforced… when the firms that would specialize in speculation and arbitrage in a free market for exchange do not exist. ’ It is clear economic power should be kept in separate hands form political power, and the issue in our society today appears to be that economic power is so concentrated amongst so few, these individuals have captured political power. It is my belief that speculation and arbitrage in the free market for exchange has contributed to that captured, and therefore somewhat imprisoned the population with a neo-liberal status-quo mentality.
Adam Smith wrote ‘It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.’  He was hinting at the reasonableness of the notion that policies can be centred around seeking equality (but only to an extent). Ever since the British tax haven came to fore, two economic changes have happened that have increased global levels of inequality. Firstly, taxes in the biggest economies have been regressively reformed, leading to a loss in tax revenue and more wealthy billionaires: ‘U.S. corporations paid about two-fifths of all U.S. income taxes in the 1950s; that share has fallen to a fifth. The top 0.1 percent of U.S. taxpayers saw their effective tax rate fall from 60 percent in 1960 to 33 percent in 2007, while their share of the income pie soared. Had the top thousandth paid the 1960 rate, the federal government would have received over $281 billion more in 2007.’  Secondly, between ‘1940 and 1971, developing countries suffered no banking crises and only sixteen currency crises, whereas in the quarter century after 1973 there were 17 banking crises and 57 currency crises’ . Tax Havens affect tax policy in a regressive way – they clearly benefit the most wealthy and not everyone else- so it can be deduced that we have departed away from Adam Smith’s simple viewpoint of progressive taxation.
 Ultra-high-net-worth individuals ‘wealth is projected to rise to $35.7 trillion, which implies an additional $8.7 trillion of newly created wealth over the next five years. If this prediction comes true, the planet’s UHNWs will have added the equivalent of the GDPs of Japan and Germany to their stock of wealth, in half a decade.’  
Rajatnaram stated - ‘A society that is indulgent towards corruption and the successfully corrupt is not, as is often argued, a liberal sophisticated society inspired with a shrewd understanding of human nature… On the contrary, it is what one sociologist has aptly termed a “kleptocracy” – a society of the corrupt, for the corrupt, by the corrupt... The essence of kleptocracy is that the functioning of the organs of authority is determined by the mechanisms of supply and demand rather than the laws and regulations; and a kleptocratic state constitutes a curiously generalised model of laissez-faire economics even if its economy is nominally socialist.’ 
In light of the figures quoted above, it seems the debate now is how harmful will having a kleptocratic state for the foreseeable be and would the outlawing of tax-havens, a tool for the kleptocratic state, lead us peacefully towards better times or have little effect. It is my view that adopting the realist stance as opposed to the idealist stance, as mentioned in the Abstract of this document, is the more positive of the two at the very least- because it infers society can get better, even if it is at a somewhat tolerable state right now.
Keynes wrote when in negotiations with America before the Bretton Woods Agreement that - ‘the decadent international but individualistic capitalist is not a success. It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous—and it doesn’t deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it, and we are beginning to despise it.’  These are strong words, and most certainly imply that Keynes would be angry were he to see the emergence of multiple tax havens, more advanced and powerful than what Switzerland was in his life-time, which are symbols of individualistic capitalism as a contrast to a community-oriented capitalism.

However, regarding why I have become more and more adverse to tax havens, I feel an argument Milton Friedman’s is even more stirring – ‘One man may prefer a routine job with much time off for basking in the sun to a more exacting job paying a higher salary; another man may prefer the opposite. If both were paid equally in money, their incomes in a more fundamental sense would be unequal. Similarly, equal treatment requires that an individual be paid more for a dirty, unattractive job than for a pleasant rewarding one. Much observed inequality is of this kind.’  
The point Milton Friedman makes, which is absolutely convincing, is that a person should be paid according to their job. Tax Havens are allowing a select-group of people who have pleasant, rewarding lives (on a surface level at least) and most likely the jobs that enjoy the most, to accumulate a yearly income for employing wealth-managers and doing nothing themselves, that would be the same as what many individuals from poor countries -teachers, doctors, cleaners, policemen etc- earn in ten years. What’s more, I believe these wealth-managers producing a costly good for society, essentially ‘regulatory arbitrage’, a modern practice involving innovative financial-legal activity that operates within the letter but against the spirit of the law. Economist Veblen identified this as a ‘shrewd practice and chicanery’  over a century ago. Nicholas Shaxson – ‘To try to tackle terrorists’ financing or the looting of African treasuries without tackling tax evasion by western companies and individuals is to set yourself up to fail’ . This is down to the structures of trusts, shells and foundations; the fact that corporations are using the same system as terrorists – and the corporations carry the money and political clout in these times; and the typical environment of Tax-Havens: being small, historically dependent or colonised and rigid politically. There will never be a panacea for corruption but abolishing tax havens would be a great way to start, and would as a side effect hugely lift the global economy- as well as somewhat reshape the economy’s focus more towards community. Straight-forward logic dictates that it should lead to greater prosperity, greater fairness and greater freedom (even if that appears to be paradoxical at face value).
