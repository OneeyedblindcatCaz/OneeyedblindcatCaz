The real economy is tax havens. And tax havens are colonial. We are living in the 21st century and the slave trade and colonial economics situations are still in place. 

The world contains approximately 60 tax havens in which Gabriel Zucman, an Associate Professor of Economics at UC Berkley, has “conservatively” estimated approximately $7.6 trillion from all nation’s wealth lies offshore (8%).

More realistically it's more. James S Henry, an American economist, lawyer, and investigative journalist has estimated that between $21 to $32 trillion lies offshore (22 -34%).

Numbers are abstract unemotive tools, so let's put that in comparison to the most famous economics disaster of recent time. 

Greece's national debt was 264,775 million euros in 2008, enough to put the millions of Greeks out of job, homeless, even suicidal. How many millions in a trillion.

A billion is a million million. A trillion is a thousand billion. 

That's a lot of dollars. 

The bigger question is to who does it belong to? The Hamiltons, the royals, the top politicians, the wealthiest Arabs, terrorists and banking families, the masons, the ones who are intent on whipping the world to work or just the celebs who couldn't share their fortune. In other words, tax havens are how the powerful people control the financial, superficial world.

It all really started in London, in 1959 with the birth of the Euromarket (Eurobond-market). Before that there was only really a much more cautious Switzerland. 

‘By late 1959 about $200 million or so was on deposit in the Euromarket in London; by the end of 1960 it had reached a billion, and a year later the total was $3 billion’. It then exploded, wolf of wolve street style, reaching $500 billion in 1980, then a net $2.6 trillion eight years later. 

This Americanised England. In 1964, eleven US banks had branches in the City of London. In 1975, fifty-eight did! The American banks killed the little English banks which actually cared about the customer. 

Now London and New York, not the little islands in the Caribbean, are the leading offshore tax havens. London hosts more foreign banks than any other financial centre. In 2008 the city accounted for half of all international trade in equities, nearly 45 percent of over-the-counter derivatives turnover, 70 percent of Eurobond turnover, 35 percent of global currency trading, and 55 percent of all international public offerings. 

New York is bigger in areas like securitization, insurance, mergers and acquisitions, and asset management, but much of its business is domestic. 

Tax havens controlled by London with Wall Street interests in mind include Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man.

In the Cayman Islands – ‘the governor sent from London remains responsible for defence, internal security, and foreign relations; he appoints the attorney general, the judiciary... The final appeal court is the Privy Council in London.’ It is our little Britain. Panama was turned into a tax haven so that the Standard Oil company could avoid paying US taxes during the construction of the Panama Canal. Panama became a US colony like a lot of little Latin-American countries, tthe detriment of Panama itself. 

In fact



So how do tax havens and the real economy work? 

They work in unison. Whilst London has a special relationship with Wall-Street banks, Switzerland has a special relationship with Europe and the rest of the world.

In 1974 the first modern survey made by the US Treasury on the holdings of US financial securities by non-American residents showed that Switzerland, a country that has scarcely more than 0.1% of the world’s population, held almost a third of all American stocks that belonged to non-Americans, far more than the United Kingdom (15%), Canada (15%), France (7%), or Germany (3%)

In the spring of 2015 foreign wealth in Switzerland will have reached $2.3 trillion. Around $1.3 trillion belongs to Europeans, or the equivalent of 6% of the financial holdings of EU households. 

Tax havens have in fact had a tendency to specialize in the various stages of wealth management, tiny Luxembourg is the ‘the number- two country in the world for the incorporation of mutual funds, after the United States.

More than 60% of accounts in Switzerland are thus held through the intermediary of shell companies headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, trusts registered in the Cayman Islands, or foundations domiciled in Liechtenstein… The Anglo- Saxon trusts do not compete with the opacity services sold by Swiss banks; the two techniques of dissimulation have, on the contrary, become fundamentally intertwined.
